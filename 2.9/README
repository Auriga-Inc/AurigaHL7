This directory contains Auriga HL7-based header files which were automatically generated in order to add
to Auriga HL7 C++ Library the implementation of the structures for the 2.9 version of the HL7 Protocol.

The activities to generate these files were part of the ongoing activities related
to the design, implementation and execution of interoperability tests
between hacca-based versus AurigaHL7-based applications.

With more details I decided to extend Auriga HL7 C++ Library with header files
implementing HL7 structures of the version 2.9 of the protocol (September 2019)
because the version 2.4 distributed with Auriga HL7 is a bit outdated (October 2000).

All the files attempt to strictly follow the syntax and conventions originally
defined by Auriga HL7 C++ Library as form of continuity, convenience and respect
for their superb work.

The source code of this extension has the following structure:
    |-- 2.9
        |-- datatype   (all basic and composite datatypes defined in the Protocol)
        |-- hello      (unit-test programs automatically generated/compiled/run foreach HL7 dataitem)
        |-- message    (all messages defined in the Protocol)
        `-- segment    (all segments defined in the Protocol)

Happy HL7ing!
