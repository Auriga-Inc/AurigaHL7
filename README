DESCRIPTION:
This document descibes the Auriga HL7 library which implements HL7
structures of the version 2.x (version 2.4 by default, please see www.hl7.org). 
The library uses C++ 0x standards; the compiller should support them to use this
library. The howto section is placed in the end of this document. The library 
provides implementation of the following features:
- HL7 Structures of the version 2.x (2.4 by default)
- Conversion the HL7 stuctures to the HL7 string (pipe).
- Conversion a pipe string into HL7 structure.
- Encoding / decoding / validating HL7 types
- MLLP HL7 protocol support

The source code of the library has the following structures:

`-- src
    |-- 2.4
    |   |-- datatype
    |   |-- message
    |   |-- segment
    |   `-- WIN
    |-- common
    |-- test
    |-- examples
    `-- thirdparty

- src - this is the top directory.
- 2.4 - this directory contains descriptio of the HL7 structures of the 2.4 version.
- datatype - HL7 data types
- mesage - HL7 messages
- segment - HL7 segments
- 2.4 / WIN - static library project for Windows
- common - it contains common code: base classes and utils that are not used thirdparty code base.
- test - source code of the tests.
	tests - tests for core objects
	socket_test - tests for HL7Socket, HL7SocketServer and HL7MLLP objects
	verify_test - tests for HL7 data verification functions
	WIN - tests compilation solution for Windows
- examples - source code of the examples
	hello - core functions example
	client - HL7MLLP client example with validation and encoding
	server - HL7SocketServer example with validation and encoding
	WIN - examples compilation solution for Windows
- thirdparty - thirdparty code.

The source code is provided as an Eclipse and MS VS 2013 projects which inclde these
directories. The projects run test applications.

Please see HOWTO file for build inctructions and example usage.
