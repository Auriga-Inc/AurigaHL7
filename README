DESCRIPTION:
This document descibes the Auriga HL7 library which implements HL7
structures of the version 2.x (version 2.4 by default, please see www.hl7.org). 
The library uses C++ 0x standards; the compiller should support them to use this
library. The howto section is placed in the end of this document. The library 
provides implementation of the following features:
- HL7 Structures of the version 2.x (2.4 by default)
- Conversion the HL7 stuctures to the HL7 string (pipe).
- Conversion a pipe string into HL7 structure.

The source code of the library has the following structures:

`-- src
    |-- 2.4
    |   |-- datatype
    |   |-- message
    |   `-- segment
    |-- common
    |-- test
    `-- thirdparty

- src - this is the top directory.
- 2.4 - this directory contains descriptio of the HL7 structures of the 2.4 version.
- common - it contains common code: base classes and utils that are not used thirdparty code base.
- test - source code of the tests.
- thirdparty - thirdparty code.

The source code is provided as an Eclipse and MS VS projects which inclde these
directories. The projects run test applications.
