This directory contains Auriga HL7-based header files which were automatically generated in order to add
to Auriga HL7 C++ Library the implementation of the structures for the 2.8.1 version of the HL7 Protocol.

With more details I decided to extend Auriga HL7 C++ Library with header files
implementing HL7 structures of the version 2.8.1 of the protocol (April 2014)
because the version 2.4 distributed with Auriga HL7 is a bit outdated (October 2000).

All the files attempt to strictly follow the syntax and conventions originally
defined by Auriga HL7 C++ Library as form of continuity, convenience and respect
for their superb work.

The source code of this extension has the following structure:
    |-- 2.8.1
        |-- datatype   (all basic and composite datatypes defined in the Protocol)
        |-- hello      (unit-test programs automatically generated/compiled/run foreach HL7 data item)
        |-- message    (all messages defined in the Protocol)
        `-- segment    (all segments defined in the Protocol)

Happy HL7ing!
