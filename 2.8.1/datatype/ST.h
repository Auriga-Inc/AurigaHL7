 * This file was developed as part of the ongoing activities related
 * to the design, implementation and execution of interoperability tests
 * between hacca-based versus AurigaHL7-based applications.
 *
 * In more details I decided to extend AurigaHL7 C++ Library with header files
 * implementing HL7 structures of the version 2.8.1 of the protocol (April 2014)
 * because the version 2.4 distributed with AurigaHL7 is a bit outdated (October 2000).
 *
 * All files in this fork was automatically generated by hacca-based tool [hawk]
 * and strictly follow the syntax and convention originally defined
 * by Auriga HL7 C++ Library just as form of continuity, convenience
 * and respect for their superb work.
